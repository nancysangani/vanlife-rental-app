# VanLife Rental App 🚐

VanLife Rental App is a React-based web application that simulates a van rental platform. The project focuses on building a real-world multi-page application using **React Router**, demonstrating client-side routing, dynamic routes, nested layouts, and scalable project structure.

This project is being developed incrementally as a learning and portfolio project, with continuous feature additions and improvements.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* **React** – Component-based UI development
* **React Router** – Client-side routing and navigation
* **Vite** – Fast development build tool
* **JavaScript (ES6+)**
* **CSS** – Styling and layout

---

## ✨ Features

* Multi-page application using React Router
* Home and About pages
* Vans listing page
* Dynamic van detail pages using URL parameters (`/vans/:id`)
* Nested routes for van details
* Shared layout and navigation
* Clean and scalable folder structure

---

## 📈 Development Timeline

* **Day 1:** Initialized the project using Vite and React. Configured React Router and created basic pages including Home and About.
* **Day 2:** Implemented the Vans listing page and dynamic van detail pages using nested routes and route parameters (`:id`).
* **Upcoming:** Host dashboard, protected routes, filters, UI improvements, and additional features.

## 🔮 Future Enhancements

* Host dashboard with nested routes
* Protected routes (authentication simulation)
* Vans filtering and sorting
* Favorites feature using localStorage
* Improved UI and responsiveness
